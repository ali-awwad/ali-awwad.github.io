# Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages

## The Story

Today I was creating a new fresh laravel project. And after installing composer packages and removing others, I got the following error:

```
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.
```

The terminal was screaming that the package I am trying to install is in conflict with another, which I know for sure that they are not and this is a fresh installation, so it can't be a dependency issue with tools that are constantly updated.

## The Solution

After searching through a lot of articles on the web, there was a down voted answer on the Stackoverflow suggesting to delete the "composer.lock" file. I thought to give it a try and it was a success. I have no idea why, but it worked.

```bash
rm composer.lock
composer install
```

If you know why this works, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

## Why This Happens

The composer.lock file locks your dependencies to specific versions. Sometimes when you're installing packages that have conflicting requirements with what's in your lock file, you'll get this error. 

Deleting the lock file allows Composer to resolve dependencies from scratch, potentially finding a working combination of package versions that satisfy all requirements.

While this solution works, it's generally better to understand the specific conflicts and resolve them properly, especially in production environments.
